# HUMAYUN_AMEL_ST2API_TP3

During the TP2, I never work alone to create an API in C#. So I had to push myself to get information and learn quickly. Maybe for the future do a little recap of how to create an API.

S.O.L.I.D principles : represents 5 important principles that respect certain rules in object-oriented programming and particularly in the .NET world. 
	- The S stands for "Single Responsibility" which translates into a single responsibility. This principle implies that your code within a class should have only one responsibility, only one type of task to perform.
	- The O corresponds to "Open / Close".The reason for this principle is very simple, your class must be open to an extension/update, but must be closed for any modifications.
	- The L stands for "Liskov Substitution".This principle stipulates in a simplified way, that an object S of a subtype T must be able to replace an object of type T without having consequences in the behavior of the program.
	- The I stands for "Interface segregation".It is a technique which consists in preferring the creation of several small interfaces which really concentrates the field in which it was produced rather than only one which would contain far too many declarations.
	- The D stands for "Dependency Inversion".This principle makes it possible to reverse the dependencies between the modules of your applications.

KISS rule : KISS stands for Keep it Simple, Stupid. The KISS principle in computer science is to make the code as simple as possible so that it is much easier to develop and maintain.

Boy scout rule :“Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it.”

Clean code : Clean Code is not a set of strict rules but rather designates a series of principles to produce code that is intuitively understandable and easy to modify. Comprehensible means in this case a code immediately intelligible by any qualified developer.

Clean architecture : The Clean Architecture aims to reduce the dependencies of your business logic with the services you consume (API, Database, Framework, Third-party Libraries), to maintain a stable application during its evolutions, its tests but also during changes or updates from external resources.

I would like to improve the code, especially by doing all the bonuses. For instance :
- have an interaction application that will allow the user to select a country with a world map
- Have the information in different languages
